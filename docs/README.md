# ClodRiver: Real-time LLM Integration for Virtual Worlds

## Project Overview

ClodRiver is an experimental system for integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) into real-time virtual environments like MUDs (Multi-User Dungeons) and MOOs (MUD Object Oriented). Unlike traditional chatbots that operate on a simple prompt-response cycle, ClodRiver aims to create AI agents that can participate naturally in multi-user virtual worlds through continuous event processing and context-aware responses.

## Core Concept

The fundamental insight driving ClodRiver is that current LLM interfaces are poorly suited for real-time, multi-participant environments. Traditional chatbots struggle in group chats and virtual worlds because they lack:

- Awareness of ongoing activities and environmental changes
- The ability to process events as they happen rather than in discrete conversation turns
- Natural integration with virtual world commands and systems
- Persistent memory and context that spans multiple interactions

## Technical Architecture

### Dual-LLM System

ClodRiver employs two specialized LLMs working in tandem:

1. **Response LLM**: Responsible for generating actions and responses within the virtual world
2. **Observer LLM**: Continuously processes incoming events and maintains consolidated context and memory

### Server-Side Custom Interface

Instead of generating human-readable text directly, the system uses a custom interface that:

- Sends underlying event data that would normally trigger text generation for human users
- Distinguishes between different types of actions (commands vs. emotes vs. environmental events)
- Provides semantic information about virtual world state changes
- Example: Differentiates between using a "sit" command vs. an "emote" command that describes sitting

### Client-Side Bridge

A NodeJS-based client acts as an intelligent bridge that:

- Continuously collects events from the virtual world server
- Batches and contextualizes events for LLM processing
- Executes commands requested by the LLMs
- Manages timing and event sequencing

#### Event Batching Strategy

The system sends contextual queries to LLMs based on temporal patterns:
- "Nothing happened for five seconds"
- "There was silence for four seconds and then the following events happened over the course of a second"
- "Since your last response, all the following has happened, including your previously requested actions"

### Memory and Context Management

#### Short-term Memory
- Observer LLM maintains consolidated "working memory" of recent events
- Continuous integration of new events into ongoing context

#### Long-term Memory
- Graph database storage for persistent memories and relationships
- Tool-based recall system using "recollection tokens"
- Observer LLM responsible for both executing lookups and integrating results

### Tool Integration

Following standard LLM tool-use patterns:

- Response LLM can emit recollection tokens to trigger memory lookups
- Graph database queries executed as external tools
- Results integrated into next API call context
- JSON-based communication for structured data exchange

## Key Technical Challenges

### Token and Response Format Design

Current LLMs lack built-in concepts for:
- Pauses and timing in responses
- Explicit memory recall attempts
- Real-time event acknowledgment

**Potential Solutions:**
- Fine-tuning on synthetic data with meta-actions
- JSON-structured outputs instead of natural language tokens
- Client-side interpretation of pause/recall logic

### Context Window Management

Continuous event streams could quickly exceed LLM context limits:
- Need efficient context summarization
- Strategic information retention and pruning
- Balance between immediate context and relevant history

### Real-time Performance

Virtual worlds require responsive interactions:
- Minimize latency between events and responses
- Efficient batching without sacrificing immediacy
- Graceful handling of high-frequency event streams

## Conversation Context: LLM Fundamentals Discussion

This project emerged from a broader discussion about LLM mechanics and capabilities:

### LLM Token Generation
- LLMs stop generation through end-of-sequence tokens, length limits, stop sequences, or contextual completion
- No true "fatigue" - stopping is based on probability distributions favoring completion

### Logical Reasoning in LLMs
- LLMs approximate logical evaluation through sophisticated pattern matching, not true calculation
- Training data patterns enable correct responses to logical problems without implementing formal reasoning
- Similar to chess players using pattern recognition vs. algorithmic move calculation

### Tool Integration Mechanisms
- LLMs generate structured sequences (often XML-like markup) to trigger tool usage
- System pauses generation, executes tools, appends results to context, then resumes generation
- Conversation history grows to include both tool requests and responses

### Current Interface Limitations
- Most LLM APIs only support streaming with abort capabilities, not mid-generation interruption
- No mainstream support for "pausing" and resuming generation with injected context
- Current architectures require reprocessing entire context for each generation cycle

## Related Technologies and Inspiration

### Existing Approaches
- **Multi-agent systems**: AutoGen, CrewAI (structured workflows)
- **Embodied AI in games**: LLMs in Minecraft and simulations (basic prompt-response)
- **Memory-augmented systems**: RAG with vector databases (batch updates)
- **Agent frameworks**: LangGraph, Microsoft Semantic Kernel (dynamic, stateful interactions)

### Novel Aspects of ClodRiver
- Continuous event stream processing vs. discrete conversation turns
- Dedicated observer LLM for context management
- Real-time virtual world integration
- Graph database memory with semantic recall
- Temporal event batching and context synthesis

## Implementation Platform

**Primary Platform**: NodeJS
- Excellent JSON parsing and generation capabilities
- Strong async/event-driven architecture for real-time processing
- Rich ecosystem for database and network integrations
- Potential for LambdaMOO integration or standalone implementation

## Project Goals

### Immediate Objectives
1. Develop proof-of-concept dual-LLM architecture
2. Create event batching and context management system
3. Implement basic graph database memory storage
4. Design JSON-based communication protocols

### Long-term Vision
1. Deploy functional AI agents in existing MUD/MOO environments
2. Create compelling demonstration of natural AI participation in virtual worlds
3. Develop reusable framework for virtual world AI integration
4. Explore commercial applications for virtual world creators

## Research and Development Questions

1. How can we optimize context window usage for continuous event streams?
2. What event batching strategies provide the best balance of responsiveness and coherence?
3. How should the graph database schema be designed for optimal memory recall?
4. What fine-tuning approaches could best teach LLMs virtual world interaction patterns?
5. How can we measure and improve the "naturalness" of AI agent participation?
